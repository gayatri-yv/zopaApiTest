# zopaApiTest
Technical Test for Zopa Quote Engine Api
Zopa Technical Test Framework using Cucumber and RestAssured for API testing.
This is the automation test project for the the api : I https://qanat-quotespublic.staging.zopa.com/api/docs.

The test scenarios are located in features folder in src->test->java->features.
There are two feature files :
1. To create a member id and to retrieve the member id.
2. To submit quote with the member id created previously.

These scenarios cover functional testing ( positive & negative scenarios).
Additional types of testing that should be considered are non-functional testing ( security & performance testing).
For security testing - passing special characters in request body & url( these are covered in negative scenarios).
For performance testing - I have prepared .jmx file. To run the performance script, download jmeter and import .jmx file.
Download .csv file provided in github.,as it will be used for test data.

            TestRunner ( provides configuration for reports, glues , and tags.)
             Note: to run specific scenarios , assign a tag on that scenario in the feature file against specific
             scenario and provide that tag in test runner,and either right click this file to run or run mvn test.
        resources
            config.json ( config file to set url and endpoints)

            Note: The values provided in the above two json files can be replaced/overwritten either in feature file or
